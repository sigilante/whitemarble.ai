                <h1>White Marble Syndicate Bylaws</h1>
                <h2>Version ~2025.7.29</h2>
                <p>White Marble Syndicate is a not-for-profit decentralized autonomous organization for the
                    acquisition, preservation, and utilization of Western classical scholarship. As a library DAO,
                    White Marble Syndicate is dedicated to preserving and curating the timeless wisdom of the
                    classical Western tradition, rooted in the Greek and Latin corpus. Our shared belief is that the
                    fragile thread of ancient knowledge—encompassing philosophy, literature, history, and art—holds
                    profound value for humanity’s understanding of itself and its future. We are committed to
                    building a pristine, member-governed repository of primary texts, translations, scholarly
                    commentary, and AI-enhanced tools to empower private research and intellectual exploration.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to create a living, evolving library that not only safeguards the classical heritage
                    but also makes it accessible and actionable for our members through research tools and
                    cutting-edge AI technologies. We uphold the values of intellectual rigor, collaborative
                    stewardship, and privacy, ensuring that our community of scholars, researchers, and enthusiasts
                    can engage deeply with the classical world in a secure and enriching environment. As a
                    syndicate, we foster a self-organizing collective where members actively shape the library’s
                    growth, governance, and innovation, preserving this cultural legacy for generations to come.</p>
                <p>The WMS library mandate is defined as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The classical heritage of Greek and Roman thought.</li>
                    <li>Received associated commentary (as on Aristotle).</li>
                    <li>Ancient antecedents (as Linear B or Etruscan).</li>
                    <li>Relevant scholarship (as treatises, forewords, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Governance &amp; Membership</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>GM1: White Marble Syndicate membership consists of token holders of one or more
                        $WHTMRBL tokens as issued by Ethereum contract
                        <code>0xbC7e36265f8f20F8113729393eC2e824235BAb7B</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>GM2: Each complete token entitles its holder to one vote.</li>
                    <li>GM3: Voting takes place off-chain via an application set up for each vote on the syndicate's
                        primary Urbit Azimuth point or a designated alternative platform approved by the board in
                        case of technical unavailability.</li>
                    <li>GM4: A quorum for voting consists of the lesser of 20% of currently issued tokens or 100
                        tokens, adjustable by member vote to ensure scalability.</li>
                    <li>GM5: Any member may bring a motion for a vote before the syndicate with the support of 5% of
                        currently issued tokens.</li>
                    <li>GM6: A proposal for voting has an associated time span between two weeks and 90 days.
                        Membership tokens acquired during the voting period may not be used in the current election
                        but are eligible for future votes. The quorum is set by the circulating supply of $WHTMRBL
                        at the proposal's starting timestamp.</li>
                    <li>GM7: The board is empowered to pursue appropriate legal organization (e.g. DUNA) consistent
                        with the unwrapped DAO's nonprofit status at any time.</li>
                    <li>GM8: The board is not empowered to seek venture capital or large-scale investment; growth
                        should be via regular utility token sales for membership.</li>
                    <li>GM9: The board may accept grants, donations, or sponsorships from entities aligned with
                        WMS’s nonprofit mission, subject to member approval via a majority vote with quorum.</li>
                    <li>GM10: The Members-at-Large shall maintain onboarding materials on governance, tokens, and
                        platform access.</li>
                    <li>GM11: The administrators serving as Librarian and Treasurer serve on the board.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Asset Management</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>AM1: White Marble Syndicate collectively owns assets related to the syndicate's mission.
                        These are listed for the current time in the bylaws appendix A.</li>
                    <li>AM2: Library assets are administered by the Librarian and Technologist.</li>
                    <li>AM3: Treasury assets are administered by the Treasurer. Due to technological limitations,
                        incoming fees are accepted at an Ethereum address held by the Treasurer and a sponsor. These
                        are carefully accounted for and moved to a multisig wallet for the general treasury. All
                        incoming fees must be directed to a multisig wallet within 60 days of receipt, with
                        transparent accounting maintained by the Treasurer.</li>
                    <li>AM4: A multisig wallet requiring (int(n/2)+1)-of-n board votes to disburse funds is required
                        (e.g., 3-of-4, 3-of-5). All fund disbursements should have an associated invoice maintained
                        by the Treasurer.</li>
                    <li>AM5: The Technologist has primary responsibility for the website, forum, library interface,
                        and tooling interfaces and infrastructure. Syndicate members may be delegated access to
                        these resources as appropriate.</li>
                    <li>AM6: The board governs $WHTMRBL issuance, aiming to maintain a stable valuation (e.g.,
                        approximately $100 USDC) through responsible issuance and reserve management, subject to
                        member approval for significant changes.</li>
                    <li>AM7: The Treasurer and board produce an annual stewardship report of White Marble Syndicate
                        finances, assets, and tokenomics.</li>
                    <li>AM8: The Treasurer and board may commission an independent audit of treasury assets and
                        tokenomics, with results published to the membership.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Administrator Roles</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>R1: Community administrators practically coordinate the activities of the syndicate as a
                        service. They are distinct from the board, although board members may serve as
                        administrators.</li>
                    <li>R2: Several roles may be held concurrently by one individual, but there must be at least
                        three signators for the DAO public keys. Some positions, like Technologist or Treasurer, may
                        also have multiple individual members serving as long as one remains the chief of that role.
                    </li>
                    <li>R3: The roles include:<ul>
                            <li><strong>Librarian</strong>. Responsible for curation and operation of the library,
                                including acquisitions of scholarship and preparation of new materials. Effectively
                                the executive role.</li>
                            <li><strong>Treasurer</strong>. Responsible for receiving, managing, and reporting on
                                community funds and expenses, including legal responsibilities like filing fees and
                                taxes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Member-at-Large</strong>. Responsible for community concerns and membership
                                scope, including experience, recruitment, and outreach.</li>
                            <li><strong>Technologist</strong>. Responsible for platform operations, including IT
                                infrastructure, AI tooling, and software tooling.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>R4: In case of a vacancy or temporary absence in a role, the board may appoint an interim
                        replacement by majority vote, pending a member election within 60 days to fill the role
                        permanently.</li>
                    <li>R5: Role holders must disclose any conflicts of interest (e.g., financial or personal ties
                        to proposed acquisitions or vendors) to the board and membership. Decisions involving
                        conflicts require approval by a majority vote of non-conflicted members.</li>
                    <li>R6: Role holders serve on a volunteer basis unless compensation is approved by a majority
                        vote with quorum, disclosed in the annual stewardship report.</li>
                </ul>
