            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Today we are publicly launching the White Marble Syndicate. This is a testbed for concepts we
                    have explored throughout <a href="https://extelligencer.substack.com/">The Extellıgencer's</a> run, and we have high hopes for its continued
                    success.</p>
                
                <p>How does a cooperative DAO fit into our institutional theory? We have learned that an optimal organization is
                    like a crab: it may have differentiated internal hierarchies and associations, but its security
                    lies in its immune function.</p>
                
                <p>Common attack surfaces include the bureaucratic and legal interface (regulatory pressure), the
                    payment processor interface, porous membership and requirements, and the quality of epistemic
                    hygiene.  (Which isn't to say to ignore the law or the regulations, only that regulatory
                    pressures have commonly been applied to organizations in an attempt to control their behavior.)</p>
                
                <p>The White Marble <a
                        href="https://syndicate.box/~~/syndicates-as-portable-digital-organizations/">Syndicate</a>
                    is thus a coordinated effort to test our theory of a crab. A curated library serves as the
                    perfect bedrock truth to avoid poison pills and memetic or technical injection attacks. Private
                    sessions with private servers avoid leaking query information and research, and further prevents
                    adversaries from training themselves on your behavior.</p>
                
                <p>More concretely, WMS takes as its mandate to collect the knowledge of the ancient world and
                    prepare it as finely as possible for utilization by AI tools. The mandate is specific and
                    finite, which should help prevent mission drift. We will begin with classical Greek and Latin
                    texts in translation and intend to move to other aspects of the classical Western tradition.
                    There are two prongs to this effort:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Curate a <a href="https://extelligencer.substack.com/p/dispatch-36">pristine</a> library of
                        original texts, translations, and scholarly commentary and analysis.</li>
                    <li>Facilitate the use of this curated library for private members of the White Marble Syndicate
                        for primary research, AI-enhanced inquiry, or simply as a secure repository.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Rather than operate as a strictly public service or open-source project, the White Marble
                    Syndicate will function as a private library for members. White Marble will collect and curate
                    resources from primary and secondary sources, and develop "tertiary" sources (fine-tuned and
                    trained LLMs, for instance). Members will be able to nominate and submit acquisitions of all
                    three kinds in the library.</p>
                
                <p>At its inception, White Marble Syndicate will simply be run as a benevolent stewardship.
                    Eventually it will be fully handed off to the community of token-bearing members for
                    self-governance.</p>
