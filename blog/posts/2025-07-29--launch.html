            <div class="post-content">
                <p>We are pleased to announce the official launch of <a href="https://whitemarble.ai">White Marble
                        Syndicate</a>, a library DAO for classical studies. WMS will serve as a curated resource
                    for members to access and utilize the wealth of knowledge stored in material from and about the
                    classical world of Greece and Rome.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://whitemarble.ai">White Marble Syndicate website (you are here)</a></li>
                    <li><a
                            href="https://portal.whitemarble.ai/apps/fund/project/~pondeg/white-marble-syndicate-membership">White
                            Marble Syndicate crowdfund</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://x.com/WhiteMarbleDAO">@WhiteMarbleDAO on ùïè</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>The wisdom of the ancient world is contained in a relatively few books handed down along tenuous
                    paths. A few million words, maybe 5% at the outside of the likely volume, survive to inform us of
                    the ancient worldview. While the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum_papyri">Herculaneum scrolls</a> promise to
                    augment this, the thread of classical Western heritage is still very slight.</p>

                <p>The White Marble <a
                        href="https://syndicate.box/~~/syndicates-as-portable-digital-organizations/">Syndicate</a>
                    takes as its mandate to collect the knowledge of the ancient world and prepare it as finely as
                    possible for utilization by AI tools. We will begin with classical Greek and Latin texts in
                    translation and intend to move to other aspects of the classical Western tradition. There are two
                    prongs to this effort:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Curate a <a href="https://extelligencer.substack.com/p/dispatch-36">pristine</a> library of
                        original texts, translations, and scholarly commentary and analysis.</li>
                    <li>Facilitate the use of this curated library for members of the White Marble Syndicate for
                        primary research, AI-enhanced inquiry, or simply as a secure repository.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Rather than operate as a clearweb service or open-source project, the White Marble Syndicate
                    will function as a library for members. White Marble will collect and curate resources from
                    primary and secondary sources, and develop "tertiary" sources (fine-tuned and trained LLMs, for
                    instance). Members will be able to nominate and submit acquisitions of all three kinds in the
                    library.</p>

                <p>White Marble's mandate lies with classical Western thought. The initial bounds of this span the Greek
                    and Latin corpus (roughly the span of the Loeb Classical Library), as well as the appropriate
                    secondary literature (dictionaries, commentaries, translations). Eventually we can imagine expanding
                    this to (say) Sumerian, Hittite, and Gaelic, but not‚Äîfor example‚Äîto Sanskrit or Old Chinese. We
                    imagine other possible PDO libraries and intelligence collectives likewise cultivating and curating
                    their own gardens of insight.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">A syndicate is a self-organizing group of individuals, companies,
                        corporations or entities formed to transact some specific business, to pursue or promote a
                        shared interest.</p>

                <p>The White Marble DAO is organized as a <a
                        href="https://syndicate.box/~~/syndicates-as-portable-digital-organizations/">syndicate</a>.
                    Purchasing a membership benefits the entire collective library. Funds (minus some modest protocol
                    and infrastructure maintenance fees) will be directed towards improving the WMS experience per the
                    roadmap, and in particular expanding the library.</p>

                <p>Members will come to an agreement on compute provision for AI tooling. This will likely be commodity
                    rates on dedicated hardware as either a monthly subscription or a per-token block buy. Details will
                    be worked out.</p>

                    What to Expect at Launch</h2>

                <p>This is a first pass on a project that we intend to live for a very long time, possibly as something
                    you will pass down to your grandchildren as a resource. At our launch, we have a modest selection of
                    classical texts in English translation available, but this is the floor not the ceiling of the
                    library.</p>

                <p>Members own the library and govern it as a free association.</p>

                <p>Make sure to watch <a href="https://x.com/WhiteMarbleDAO">@WhiteMarbleDAO</a> for announcements as
                    the forum and platform come online.</p>

                <h2
                    style="font-size: 1.8rem; color: #2c3e50; margin: 2rem 0 1rem; font-weight: normal; border-bottom: 1px solid #e9ecef; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                    Roadmap</h2>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: #2c3e50; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem; font-weight: normal;">Library
                    Expansion</h3>

                <p>White Marble Syndicate launches with classical texts in English translation, but the mandate is much
                    larger. WMS will collect materials which have been previously scanned as well as acquiring new texts
                    from physical libraries which are not yet available online. We are also accepting suggestions from
                    members.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: #2c3e50; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem; font-weight: normal;">User
                    Experience</h3>

                <p>What is a wonderful library without a wonderful reading experience? While source documents are simply
                    stored in plaintext to start off, we plan a better reading experience for WMS including bookmarking,
                    cross-referencing, and AI-assisted commentary.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: #2c3e50; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem; font-weight: normal;">AI Tooling
                </h3>

                <p>White Marble Syndicate is something of a realized paradox: a world with artificial intelligence
                    requires both pristine source documents and effective augmented research. We will continue to adopt
                    new open-source models and approaches in fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation, while
                    firmly maintaining our commitment to private sessions with private data.</p>

                </h3>

                <p>For project maturity, WMS needs to carry out the following tasks:</p>
